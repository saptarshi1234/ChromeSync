# All-in-one party

All-in-one Party is a Chrome extension for watching video on any streaming site remotely with friends, e.g., for movie nights with that long-distance special someone. It synchronizes video playback and adds group chat.

This is a Chrome extension. The source for the server can be found [here](https://github.com/devclub-iitd/netflixparty-server). This extension can be used to watch any streaming site not only Netflix. You no longer need to have separate extensions for **Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hotstar, Disney** etc. This is a **one stop** solution for all your remote partying needs. This will not only work on paid streaming sites but will also work on the free ones like **YouTube, Vimeo, and any other site that offers video streaming capabilities.**


## Developers

This Chrome extension is a redistribution of the original chrome extension for netflix i.e. [Netflix Party](https://www.netflixparty.com/) and has been developed by [DevClub](https://github.com/devclub-iitd)
